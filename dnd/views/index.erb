Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.<br>
If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends."},

## The backgrounds were towards the end of this project, and as a result, were implemented much better than classes/races, making it fairly easy to add content to down the road.
## 
## The @master_hash is a hash(colletion) of hashes and is iterated through to generate the tabs and content 
## for the background selection. Adding to this hash with additional backgrounds and properties will 
## autogenerate the appropriate tabs by the area directly underneath the hash.
## 
## Any features that are to be automatically populated need to be highlighted with a div/span with the id of
## (backgroundname)_bg_features. If the background has a space, you'll need to use &nbsp; (reference Folk Hero)
## 
## NOTE: Due to the unique characterstic of each background, the bg_characteristics and bg_feature keys are used often
## as a dumping ground for filler content and unique bg things that don't fit any other key, 
## as you can see in the exiting backgrounds.  Whatever string info is put in those keys are simply evaluated at 
## the end of the content page as html, so feel adding tables, etc. is A-OK, just be careful of quotes.

  <h2>FAQ</h2><br>
   <p><strong>Why?</strong><br>
   I think 5E is pretty nifty, but I couldn't find a good, responsive, 5E generator that I liked (and I wanted to learn jQuery). I wanted something I could link to friends and have them get a character made in minutes, with or without their phone. If you're a developer and you have functionality you want to add, grab <a href="https://github.com/bananatron/Character-Builder-5e">the source</a> and get going.
  <p><strong>How do I save my character?</strong><br>
   D5B is not currently connected to any database. As a result, there is no online storage of character data at this time. You can save the file from your browser and (if your browser gets all the dependancies) it should be viewable and editable locally.
  <p><strong>What browsers are supported?</strong><br>
    D5B is not being <i>supported</i>, but your best bet is to use a modern, non-IE, browser like Firefox or Chrome.
  <p><strong>What tech was used to make D5B?</strong><br>
  D5B's core front-end functionality comes from JS/jQuery on top of Foundation CSS. It uses Ruby and Sinatra to quickly generate HTML data with embedded Ruby and is hosted on Heroku.
  <p><strong>How can I help?  </strong><br>
  You can help by taking the source and making something better (or just making something better, in general), or by buying the PHB through my <a href=<%= @amz_link %>>amazon referral link</a>.<br><br>
