<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You have two, 1st level spell slots available at cleric level one. Unlike Wizards, clerics do not need a spellbook to store their spells, and are assumed to know every cleric spell their spell slots can afford them.
<br><br>
<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
<br><br>
<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
<br>
<h4>Divine Domain</h4>
Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. See the Player’s Handbook for details on all the domains.<br>
Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.<i>(Choose 1 below)</i>
<br><br>
<div class="panel">The Life domain is currently the only domain in the basic rules. If any option besides the life domain is chosen, you will need to update your character sheet on the next page manually with the rules found in the PHB.</div>

<input id="life_domain" name="ch_cleric_style" class = "ch_cleric_style" type="radio" value="Life Domain: While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. (Not included in AC)"><label for="life_domain">Life</label><br>
<b>Benefits</b>: Proficiency with heavy armor, healing spells heal for an increase of 2 + the spell's level. You gain more benefits with each level.
<br><i>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities.</i>
